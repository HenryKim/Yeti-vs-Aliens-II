How to use the level editor
===========================

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

cd wherever/this/file/is
./yva.py -e mybrandnewlevel.level

You should now have a window with a tile palette on the left, and a
map on the right.

Click on one of the tiles in the palette (any but the first one). Now
click somehere inside the map. The tile you selected should appear. If
you placed the tile near the ground, try jumping on it.

Now try holding your left mouse button while dragging. You should leave
a trail of tiles. Clean up your mess using the right mouse button.

Walk right until the camera stops moving. You're now at the end of the
universe. Press + to make the world a little wider. If you liked the
small world better, you can press - to go back.

Congratulations, you've mastered the level editor. Now go make some
awesome levels!
